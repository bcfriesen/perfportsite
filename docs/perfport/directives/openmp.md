# OpenMP

OpenMP is a specification for a set of compiler directives, library routines,
and environment variables that can be used to specify high-level parallelism in
Fortran and C/C++ programs. The OpenMP API uses the fork-join model of parallel
execution. Multiple threads of execution perform tasks defined implicitly or
explicitly by OpenMP directives. (_Text taken from [OpenMP
FAQ](http://www.openmp.org/about/openmp-faq/) and [API
specification](http://www.openmp.org/wp-content/uploads/openmp-4.5.pdf)._)

Although the directives in early versions of the OpenMP specification focused
on thread-level parallelism, more recent versions (especially 4.0 and 4.5) have
generalized the specification to address more complex types (and multiple
types) of parallelism, reflecting the increasing degree of on-node parallelism
in HPC architectures. In particular, OpenMP 4.0 introduced the `simd` and
`target` constructs. We discuss each of these in detail below.

## `omp simd`

Decorating a loop with the `simd` construct informs the compiler that the loop
iterations are independent and can be executed with SIMD instructions (e.g.,
AVX-512 on Intel Xeon Phi), e.g.,

```Fortran
!$omp simd
do i = 1, array_size
  a(i) = b(i) * c(i)
end do
!$omp end simd
```

Example output from a compiler optimization report for this loop is as follows:
```
LOOP BEGIN at main.f90(9,3)
   remark #15388: vectorization support: reference A(i) has aligned access   [ main.f90(10,5) ]
   remark #15388: vectorization support: reference B(i) has aligned access   [ main.f90(10,12) ]
   remark #15388: vectorization support: reference C(i) has aligned access   [ main.f90(10,19) ]
   remark #15305: vectorization support: vector length 16
   remark #15399: vectorization support: unroll factor set to 4
   remark #15301: OpenMP SIMD LOOP WAS VECTORIZED
   remark #15448: unmasked aligned unit stride loads: 2
   remark #15449: unmasked aligned unit stride stores: 1
   remark #15475: --- begin vector cost summary ---
   remark #15476: scalar cost: 6
   remark #15477: vector cost: 0.310
   remark #15478: estimated potential speedup: 19.200
   remark #15488: --- end vector cost summary ---
LOOP END
```

The `simd` construct can be combined with the traditional `parallel for` (or
`parallel do` in Fortran) constructs in order to execute the loop with both
multi-threading and with SIMD instructions, e.g.,

```Fortran
!$omp parallel do simd
do i = 1, array_size
  a(i) = b(i) * c(i)
end do
!$omp end parallel do simd
```

The optimization report for the above snippet is as follows:

```
Begin optimization report for: MAIN

    Report from: OpenMP optimizations [openmp]

main.f90(8:9-8:9):OMP:MAIN__:  OpenMP DEFINED LOOP WAS PARALLELIZED

    Report from: Vector optimizations [vec]

   remark #15389: vectorization support: reference b(i) has unaligned access   [ main.f90(10,12) ]
   remark #15389: vectorization support: reference c(i) has unaligned access   [ main.f90(10,19) ]
   remark #15381: vectorization support: unaligned access used inside loop body
   remark #15305: vectorization support: vector length 32
   remark #15399: vectorization support: unroll factor set to 2
   remark #15309: vectorization support: normalized vectorization overhead 0.667
   remark #15301: OpenMP SIMD LOOP WAS VECTORIZED
   remark #15449: unmasked aligned unit stride stores: 1
   remark #15450: unmasked unaligned unit stride loads: 2
   remark #15475: --- begin vector cost summary ---
   remark #15476: scalar cost: 6
   remark #15477: vector cost: 0.370
   remark #15478: estimated potential speedup: 15.670
   remark #15488: --- end vector cost summary ---
LOOP END
```

It is important to note that compilers generally analyze loops (even those
undecorated with `omp simd`) to determine if they can be executed with SIMD
instructions; applying this OpenMP construct usually allows the compiler to
skip its loop dependency checks and immediately generate a SIMD version of the
loop. Consequently, improper use of `omp simd`, e.g., on a loop which indeed
carries dependencies between iterations, can generate wrong code. This
construct shifts the burden of correctness from the compiler to the user.

For example, consider the following loop, with a write-after-read dependency:
```Fortran
do i = 1, array_size
  a(i) = b(i) * a(i-1)
end do
```

Attempting to compile it without the `simd` construct yields the following
optimization report:

```
LOOP BEGIN at main.f90(8,3)
   remark #15344: loop was not vectorized: vector dependence prevents vectorization
   remark #15346: vector dependence: assumed FLOW dependence between a(i) (9:5) and a(i-1) (9:5)
LOOP END
```

The compiler has determined that the loop iterations cannot be executed in
SIMD. However, if we introduce the `simd` construct, this assures the compiler
(incorrectly) that the loop iterations can be executed in SIMD. Using the
construct results in the following report:

```
LOOP BEGIN at main.f90(9,3)
   remark #15388: vectorization support: reference A(i) has aligned access   [ main.f90(10,5) ]
   remark #15388: vectorization support: reference B(i) has aligned access   [ main.f90(10,12) ]
   remark #15389: vectorization support: reference A(i-1) has unaligned access   [ main.f90(10,19) ]
   remark #15381: vectorization support: unaligned access used inside loop body
   remark #15305: vectorization support: vector length 32
   remark #15399: vectorization support: unroll factor set to 2
   remark #15301: OpenMP SIMD LOOP WAS VECTORIZED
   remark #15448: unmasked aligned unit stride loads: 1
   remark #15449: unmasked aligned unit stride stores: 1
   remark #15450: unmasked unaligned unit stride loads: 1
   remark #15475: --- begin vector cost summary ---
   remark #15476: scalar cost: 6
   remark #15477: vector cost: 0.340
   remark #15478: estimated potential speedup: 17.450
   remark #15488: --- end vector cost summary ---
LOOP END
```

This example illustrates the prescriptive nature of OpenMP directives; they
allow the user to instruct the compiler precisely how on-node parallelism
should be expressed, even if the compiler's own correctness-checking heuristics
indicate that the desired approach will generate incorrect results.


## omp target

The OpenMP `target` device construct maps variables to a device data
environment and executes the construct on that device. A region enclosed with
the `target` construct is assigned a target task to be executed on the device.
This construct supports several additional keywords which provide the user with
control of which data is moved to and from the device. Specifically, data
movement is achieved via the `map` keyword, which accepts a list of variables
to be copied between the host and device.

Consider the following snippet:
```Fortran
!$omp target map(to:b,c) map(from:a)
do i = 1, array_size
  a(i) = b(i) * c(i)
end do
!$omp end target
```

The compiler report from the following code offloaded to an Intel Xeon Phi
coprocessor is as follows:

```

Note in the last compiler report that OpenMP automatically threads the loop and
partitions the threads into threadblocks of the appropriate size for the device
executing the loop.
